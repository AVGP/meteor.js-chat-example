meteor.js Chat example

This is a very simple example of a chat application done with meteor.js.

The client-side consists of a few css-files (3 from blueprint-css and one actual application CSS file.) plus the index.html with the necessary template declarations and the client.js for the interactive parts.
 The server-side is just the bare server startup code in server/server.js
